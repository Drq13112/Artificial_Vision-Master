# Number plate detection and recognition

The objective of this project is to create a computer vision algorithm
computer vision algorithm capable of detecting car number plates in images and videos of urban and multiple situations.

Several methods were explored and developed to achieve the goal. The success of this project was a bit disappointing. Overall, the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) function turned out to be the weakest chain in the process. This leads to a good recognition rate, but extremely poor capability to know the character inside the plates.

On the other hand, the OBR and CNN (Yolov8 trained with a custom dataset) methods achieve a good ratio, above 80% and 95% respectively in detecting the plate in the image and cropping its area correctly.
